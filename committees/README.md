Individual committee mandates and additional terms of reference will be drafted by each committee, approved by the Board, and may be amended from time to time with approval of the Board.

## Membership and Appointment

Each committee will be chaired by a non-staff member of the Board who reports to the Board regarding Committee business, decisions and activities. Committees will be comprised ideally of 3-5 members, including the chair, staff and volunteers. Members may be appointed to a committee by the chair or the board of directors.
