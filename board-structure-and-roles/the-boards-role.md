# The Board’s Role

The Board is the group that leads TMAC and is the backbone of our collaborative work, setting its strategic direction and synthesizing input from the community into its programming. While we rely on trust and mutual accountability in service of the welfare and goals of the organization, we also believe that documenting our policies and procedures in this manual will ensure that the collaborative process will serve TMAC well into the future.

**The role of the board is to enable the organization to carry out its mandate, which, in part, is to:**

* Provide performances and exhibitions of an artistic nature in premises to be maintained and operated by TMAC
* Provide instructional seminars, conferences and workshops on topics relating to the arts exhibited and performed at the premises
* Make available to the public visual arts, media arts, film/video and electronic/digital arts.
* Provide affordable, long-term rental, gallery, production and exhibition space to non-profit arts organizations

  * Property taxes
  * Mortgage repayment
  * Capital reserve
* Actively build collaborative relationships with each of its Member organizations to support the delivery of joint programming
* Form a Joint Planning Committee that will work to:
