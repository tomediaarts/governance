* Arrange for the Vice Chair/President to chair in the meeting if required
* Chair the Annual General Meeting and any other general member meetings that may be called
* Provide oversight of the work of the corporation on behalf of the Board, handle any personnel issues that may arise between Members of the Board or as a result of non-performance of duties by a Director or conflict of interest situations handle member complaints arising out of the actions of the staff or volunteers
