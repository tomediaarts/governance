# Board Member Code of Conduct

## Decision-making

The Board is committed to effective collaborative decision-making and, once a decision has been made, speaking with one voice. Towards this end board members:
* Reflect their understanding of member and stakeholder interests
* Represent one’s own view as an individual view
* Endeavor to build on other’s ideas or offer alternative points of view as options to be considered and invite others to do so too
* Refrain from trying to influence other board members outside of board meetings that might have the effect of creating factions and limiting free and open discussion
* On important issues, be balanced in one’s effort to understand other board members and to make oneself understood
* Once made, support, indeed defend, board decisions, even if one’s own view is a minority one
* Endeavor in good faith to reach consensus on solutions

## Authority, Confidentiality and External Communication

The Board is committed to clear, unified and uncompromising communication with staff, stakeholders and members of the public. Toward this end, board members must:

* Not disclose or discuss differences of opinion on the board outside of board meetings, especially with staff or members
* Respect the confidentiality of information on sensitive issues, especially in personnel matters
* Refrain from speaking for the organization unless authorized to do so by the board
* Disclose one’s involvement with other organizations, businesses or individuals where such a relationship might be viewed as a conflict of interest (see Conflict of Interest Policy)
* Refrain from giving direction, as an individual board member, to the executive director or any member of staff

## Internal Communication and Values

The Board is committed to building relationships built on trust with members, staff, directors and volunteers. Towards this end board members must:

* Maintain trust through ongoing transparent communication
* Share credit for the work of the organization with the collaborators, creating a sense of cohesion and mutual value
* Support the common agenda over individual agendas
* Focus on the strengths and abilities of all stakeholders to build lasting change
* Encourage conversations that build deep understanding of all perspectives, to learn together and to seek to build respect and trust
* Share knowledge and work together to co-create new sustainable ideas
* Take a patient and long view, recognizing that ideas and opportunities need the right conditions to take root and will require iterative and sometimes challenging work
* Have a serious regard for the collaboration and a determination not to let it be subverted
