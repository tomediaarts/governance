# Sponsorship and Fundraising Policy

TMAC affirms the position that core funding for arts programs remains the responsibility of various levels of government. We also believe the development of stronger links to the community, through fundraising, provides additional resources to enhance and build broader public support for arts programming. We are committed to fundraising based on ethical standards and within a socially responsible framework.

* TMAC will actively solicit and accept financial support from donors and sponsors who agree with this philosophy and whose organizational practices meet these standards.
* TMAC commits to managing responsibly the funds that donors entrust to us, and to report our financial affairs accurately and completely.
* TMAC is committed to responding to donor or prospective donor questions or concerns about fundraising activities promptly and fairly.
* TMAC supports a diversified and coordinated approach to funding and eschews competition for the good of the culture of TMAC and the financial sustainability of its member organizations.
* TMAC commits to using appropriate resources for the benefit of TMAC as a whole rather than individual members.
