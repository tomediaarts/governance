# Communication Policy

All communications within TMAC will support the mission, vision, values and goals of the Board.

The Board will:

* *Develop a communications plan* which identifies who the Board communicates with, what is communicated, when communication activities occur (e.g., press releases), and how communications are delivered
* *Establish communication links* with the stakeholders and communities we serve, local governing bodies, arts organizations, ministries and funders
* *Use communication strategies* which are open and honest, responsive, informed and clear
