# Security of Membership

Tenants members have security of tenancy. This means that a tenant member can continue to occupy its allocated space until:

* The tenant member decides to leave and gives TMAC proper notice that they intend to move out
* TMAC and tenant member agree that the tenant member will move out
* TMAC gives the tenant a notice to end the tenancy for a reason allowed by the Membership Agreement (for example, the tenant member is no longer carrying on activities allowed by the agreement).
