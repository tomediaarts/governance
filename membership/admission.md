# Admission

Admission to tenant membership is at the discretion of the Board.

Eligibility for tenant membership may be subject to specified criteria. At a minimum, the organization must:

* Be an incorporated not-for-profit or charity
* Support the objectives of TMAC
* Demonstrate organizational capacity, including an established board of directors, community-base, and appropriate programming
* When TMAC admits a tenant member, they enter into a membership agreement, a contract in which the tenant agrees to pay rent for the right to occupy a specified unit or units within the TMAC facility. The membership license may be open or for a fixed term, according to the agreement.
