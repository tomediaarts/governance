# Membership

## Members of the Corporation

According to Section 2 of the TMAC Bylaws, “Membership in the Corporation shall be limited to corporations and unincorporated associations / organizations that are either non-profit organizations or registered charities within the meaning of the Income Tax Act (Canada) whose purposes are to advance the public’s appreciation and understanding of, or otherwise promote public interest in, the arts, and which are interested in furthering the objects of the Corporation and whose application for admission as a Member has received the approval of the Board.”

Once the TMAC facility is operational, the Board intends to establish additional Membership classes with different rights and commitments than currently established by the TMAC Bylaws and definitions of Membership in the TMAC Board Governance.

## Admission

Admission to tenant membership is at the discretion of the Board.

Eligibility for tenant membership may be subject to specified criteria. At a minimum, the organization must:

* Be an incorporated not-for-profit or charity
* Support the objectives of TMAC
* Demonstrate organizational capacity, including an established board of directors, community-base, and appropriate programming
* When TMAC admits a tenant member, they enter into a membership agreement, a contract in which the tenant agrees to pay rent for the right to occupy a specified unit or units within the TMAC facility. The membership license may be open or for a fixed term, according to the agreement.

## Security of Membership

Tenants members have security of tenancy. This means that a tenant member can continue to occupy its allocated space until:

* The tenant member decides to leave and gives TMAC proper notice that they intend to move out
* TMAC and tenant member agree that the tenant member will move out
* TMAC gives the tenant a notice to end the tenancy for a reason allowed by the Membership Agreement (for example, the tenant member is no longer carrying on activities allowed by the agreement).

## Termination

TMAC may terminate tenant membership if the tenant member violates any terms of the Membership Agreement. The procedure for termination and appeal is set out in the Membership Agreement.

Members may terminate membership by providing at least 180-days’ written notice to TMAC. Unless agreed otherwise, membership terminates on the 181st day following notice. The tenant member must move out and remove all possessions by the termination date.

If a tenant member moves out of the TMAC facility without giving notice or without giving proper notice, membership ends on the earlier of:

* The date the unit is rented to another tenant or
* The earliest termination date that could have been put in a notice to end a tenancy, if the tenant had given proper notice.

The tenant member must fulfill all obligations of membership and abide by all terms of the Membership Agreement until the termination date, including:

* Paying rent
* Paying membership dues
* Contributing to and carrying out any planned joint programming responsibilities with TMAC and/or other tenant members, unless a plan for transitioning these responsibilities is agreed to by the tenant member, TMAC and any party to existing funding or planning agreements

## Responsibilities of Members

Members have a responsibility to:

* Use allocated and shared space only for the purposes allowed and set out in the Membership Agreement and any governing policies set out by TMAC from time to time.
* Manage, staff and maintain their own private spaces as required
* Represent the interests of their individual members and community base through the Membership committee
* Participate in joint programming activities, including work on Board committees and the Joint Programming Committee
* Pay rent and annual membership dues on time

## Rights of Members

The rights of tenant members are set out in Sections 2-6 in the TMAC Bylaws, the Membership Agreement and the Memorandum of Understanding between founding Members as applicable.
Generally, tenant member organizations are entitled to:

* Exclusive licensed use of the private space allocated to them in the Membership Agreement, at the rate set forth in the agreement
* The benefits of shared services as detailed in the Membership Agreement
