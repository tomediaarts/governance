# Guiding Principles

The goal of our collaboration is to:

* Plan for and build an organization that exists for the benefit of the community in which TMAC is situated
* Sustain and grow the diverse and autonomous work of its members
* Create a framework for positive and enduring change in the Toronto media arts landscape

Building on the founding vision of TMAC as a “cluster” of independent member organizations, we leverage each other’s deep experience planning, structuring and producing new art works for joint programming opportunities that would not have been possible before we came together as TMAC. At the same time, we create efficiencies through shared facilities, staffing, and infrastructure—reducing each organization’s precarity and allowing Member resources to flow to new initiatives and artists rather than administrative overhead and commercial rents.

The collaborative governance model is the natural evolution of TMAC, and the articulation of an adaptive structure that will serve TMAC now and in the years ahead.

The position TMAC strives to take within the community is that of a collaborator, valuing the input of all stakeholders working towards the goal of broad understanding and a sustainable future for the organizations and artists at the cutting edge of technoculture, art, and interactive media.

We strive to build relationships and trust between member organizations, artists, the public, and other stakeholders by focusing on our strengths, encouraging deep understanding, centering co-creation and iterating over our best and most ambitious ideas.

All of TMAC’s member organizations have worked cooperatively for many years, and are now moving towards roles that expound upon these experiences and allow us to build something bigger—a true platform for our transformative work.
