TMAC aspires to be a centre for excellence for the media arts that takes an accessible approach to the advancement of culture and technology.

### Vision

In the heart of Toronto’s Art and Design District, TMAC is creating a diverse and collaborative environment where anyone can engage meaningfully with art and technology. TMAC integrates creation, production, presentation, education, conservation and dissemination practices and with a focus on community building and inclusivity.

With year-round arts and cultural programming, open lab studios, equipment libraries, coworking and social areas, we provide the tools, space and freedom to play with art, media and new technologies–including film, videogames, audio, video, robotics, electronics and more.

TMAC grew out of grassroots community support and in response to a need for an accessible and affordable centre dedicated to media art and technology.

The idea for TMAC was first conceptualized in 2003 after almost 15 years of organizing. After an initial feasibility study, we incorporated in 2011 and attained charitable status in 2013. Today, TMAC has organically grown into an integrated collaborative organization supporting its members, the West Queen West community, and all of Toronto's media artists and artist-run centres.

### Milieu
The Toronto Media Arts Centre includes all three streams of contemporary media art practices: production, exhibition and distribution. Media art encompasses artworks that are created and displayed using time-based technologies including audio, video, film, gaming, digital, robotics, photography, interactive, online, electronics, radio and sound.

Our sector is extremely well developed in Toronto, with over 40 organizations serving and supporting a broad community of makers. We will establish a contemporary facility that will increase the visibility and accessibility of the media arts by creating a unique destination. The centre will be a landmark art facility dedicated to audience engagement, education, production and post-production, distribution, archiving and preservation, artistic residencies and a full range of arts presentation. TMAC is a new model for collaboration, one we’ve been working hard to establish for decades and that is extremely rare in Canada and the world.
